			<p> <font size="4"> This is a website about Counter Strike: Global Offensive. It is the fourth game in the Counter Strike series. It was a very popular game during its peak, which was in 2013, but cheaters are ruining the game and killing its fanbase at an alarming rate. Many players and streamers left to go play more popular games such as: Player Unknown's Battlegrounds and Fortnite. The main people that are left are loyal fans of the series, desperately trying to hold on to what they love. </font> </p>
